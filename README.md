# Capstone
This project consists of an API with a Python backend, and stores data in a Postgresql database. This project will also incorporate third-party authentication with Role Based Access Control using Auth0. The project doesn't utilize a frontend at this time.  The premise of the baseball_agency API is a system that holds player, team, and agent information. Various data are stored about each entity, and are linked using db relationships. The db included in this project has full rosters for 5 major league teams, information on those teams, as well as 10 agents.  Players are assigned to their real life teams, but randomly assigned to agents. When a player is added to the database, a team_id and agent_id are required. Additionally, an agent or team can't be deleted from the database if players are assigned to either. A player can only be assigned to one team or agent, but a team or agent can have many players assigned to them.
